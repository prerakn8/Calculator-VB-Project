Developed by Prerak Naik, 2024.

This is a Number Calculator developed by me, Prerak Naik, for my Computer Science class. I decided to publish it, because while it may not be perfect, it's surprisingly good for a number calculator.

The application uses Visual Basic. The application has been designed in a "dark mode" color scheme, so that it is better on the eyes, and is inspired by the IOS calculator app. The application has user input validation.

If you would like to download and run the application, download the .ZIP, and extract all to a folder of your choice. You can run the exe in the debug folder to start the application.

Users can input different calculations for any purpose. This calculator also does square roots and exponents.

You are allowed to use this project for the sole purpose of number calculations. You may not reverse engineer, copy, plagiarize, or relabel the project as your own.

If you think this is great, please look at my other projects on my Github page.
